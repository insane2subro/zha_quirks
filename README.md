I made a custom quirk for this device specifically TZ3000_abrsvsou - TS004F

![ce0f04077dbc709c84611b6919e52a2d92e379d7](https://github.com/insane2subro/zha_quirks/assets/1000735/a3f1d1e9-c197-43d5-9af8-e7d892f9f1d7)

Supports : 
Mode Change from Hue / Temp Control and Normal Mode(Detect Tripple Presses for Mode Change).
Single Click, Double and Toggle, Left Rotate, Right Rotate in Each of the modes independently.
Press and Rotate - Left Right in Hue Mode only. 
Hope this helps someone :slight_smile:
